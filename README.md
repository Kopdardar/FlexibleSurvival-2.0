the only files right now need to run are in the www file.  If you want to run the game download the project and double click on www/index.html to run it.  The main branch is probably super buggy, stick with the realeases to grab the project when i was at a phase where i feel like i ironed out most of the bugs.  Download the main project if you want the most up to date stuff.
